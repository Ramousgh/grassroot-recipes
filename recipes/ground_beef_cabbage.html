            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This ground beef and cabbage recipe was my mother's. She was a country cook,
                    plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods 
                    from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared,
                    while simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and 
                    love in a dish to make it extra-special.
                    Serve with corn on the cob and cornbread.<hr>
