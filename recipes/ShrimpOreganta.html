    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Definitely use very <em>large shrimp</em> for this shrimp oreganata recipe. 
        Think shrimp scampi meets a crunchy baked Parmesan topping. 
        You can serve them as an appetizer, on top of cooked pasta with extra lemon-butter sauce, 
        or simply with some bread and flavorful olive oil to dip in.</p><hr>

    <h2>Steps</h2>  
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <img src="../img/shrimp_oreganta/shrimp-oreganta-ingredient.jpg" alt="our ingredients are ready">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). <br>
                Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Peel shrimp, leaving tails intact.</li>
                <img src="../img/shrimp_oreganta/shrimp_1.jpg" alt="Peeled shrimp">
            <li>Use a paring knife to cut lengthwise down vein side of shrimp,<br> 
                cutting almost but not all the way through the shrimp. <br>
                Remove the vein and gently press shrimp apart to butterfly it.</li>
                <img src="../img/shrimp_oreganta/shrimp_2.jpg" alt="cut shrimp">
            <li>Combine shrimp, wine, olive oil, salt, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 tablespoon
                garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper in a bowl; 
                toss to coat shrimp evenly. Let stand at room temperature for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                <img src="../img/shrimp_oreganta/shrimp_step5.jpg" alt="prepared shrimp">
            <li>Meanwhile, combine panko, Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 
                remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 tablespoon garlic, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 
                and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper in a small bowl; stir until well blended.</li>
                <img src="../img/shrimp_oreganta/step6.jpg" alt="mixed ingredients">
            <li>Remove shrimp from marinade and place, cut side up, about 2 inches apart on the prepared 
                baking sheet. Top each shrimp with about 2 teaspoons panko mixture, pressing lightly to adhere.</li>
                <img src="../img/shrimp_oreganta/step7.jpg" alt="ingredients prepared for baking">
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Without opening oven, 
                switch oven to broil. Broil until topping is golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer shrimp to a platter</strong>. Stir together lemon juice, remaining 1 tablespoon melted
                butter and any accumulated juices from the baking sheet in a small bowl; drizzle evenly over shrimp on platter 
                and garnish with parsley. Serve hot with lemon wedges.</li>
