This is my first project at Grassroot Software Acadamy. The first week of the foundation course is an introduction to HTML, the basic topics covered include; HTML boiller plate, working with text, comments in HTML, links and images in HTML, and Lists.
In this project, I practiced all of the HTML knowledge I acquired from the introduction course to build a basic recipe website.
The website consist of a main index page which have links to a few recipes.
This project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
